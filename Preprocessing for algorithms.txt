I put helper functions in a file called utils_preprocessing.R, which is eventually going to be renamed into 01_preprocessing.R.

Also thought about performance/loss metrics that can be used for evaluation of models:

1. PR-AUC Score
	i. Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve
	ii. Better for severely imbalanced datasets
2. Macro-F1
	i. Treats classes equally
	ii. Better than accuracy which can be misleading
	iii. Better for imbalanced datasets
3. Binary Cross-Entropy (Log-Loss)
	i. Shows probabilistic sharpness
	ii. Shows if the probabilities are statistically consistent
4. Brier Score
	i. Can be decomposed into Calibration Error and Refinement (Resolution)
	ii. Evaluates absolute accuracy
	iii. Complements Log-Loss (Binary Cross-Entropy)


Next steps:

1. Wait for the groupmates to finish their versions
2. Come to a consensus and push the final decision to the main branch after making sure it works
3. Discuss on who is going to implement which model
4. Start working on Literature Review
