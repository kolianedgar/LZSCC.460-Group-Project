Models that can be used for predictive modelling and tunable hyperparameters:

1. Penalised logistic regression (Elastic Net)
	i. alpha: Mixing parameter for L1 and L2
	ii. lambda: Regularisation strength

2. Random Forest
	i. mtry: # of variables sampled at each split
	ii. ntree: # of trees
	iii. nodesize: minimum # of samples/leaf
	iv. max.depth: maximum depth of the tree

3. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/GBM)
	i. nrounds: # of iterations of boosting
	ii. eta: learning rate
	iii. subsample: row subsampling (reduce overfitting)
	iv. colample_bytree: feature subsampling
	v. min_child_weight: minimum leaf weight

Models that can be used for statistical modelling:

Logit logistic regression
	i. no regularisation (L1, L2, Elastic Net)
	ii. no cross-validation
	iii. purely for showing theory
